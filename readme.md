React to web react-dom.
react to mobile react-native.

js should always
call in html with script tag.
with out that i can't manupilate.

react is spa single page application

here js is add by react scripts.
this will inject js to html

but vite is not giving react scipt they directly load js in html

jsx can return only return one element
so use fragment <></>. to solve issue we can use <div> also .

use .jsx and give function name in capital letter.

// some time just reload project.

// UI update is control and handle by react.
